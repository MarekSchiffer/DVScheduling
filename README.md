# Personal write-up on DV Scheduling
Motivated by the seemingly arbitrary out of order scheduling of DV cases
at the US embassy of Frankfurt on May 13, 2022 this write-up came about.

It illustrates KCC' scheduling on a few examples and goes into more details
on AV queues, AV transition date

## Animated Graphs:
Animated graphs for a few embassies added to illustrate the cutoff line
running away from the scheduled cases, which seem to follow a virtual
cutoff line.
